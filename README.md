# HTML Practice Projects
This repository contains my hands-on HTML practice exercises and mini-projects. It's part of my journey to strengthen my front-end web development skills.
Each file demonstrates concepts like semantic HTML, forms, tables, media embedding, and page structure. These are foundational steps toward becoming a proficient front-end developer.
I'm continuously updating this repository as I learn new concepts. Feedback is always welcome!
